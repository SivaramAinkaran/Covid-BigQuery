# Covid-BigQuery
A Brief look at the Covid Crisis through SQL and Tableau

An analysis of Covid data to see the general effect of Covid and the effect vaccines have had on Covid cases and deaths.

The included "covid_cases to may_18.csv" and "covid_vaccines to may_18.csv" are the two datasets used in this project. 

The included "Covid Vizzes.twbx" file is a workbook of the visualisations used to create the tableau dashboard which can be found here:
